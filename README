#PHP Graph Plotter
This is a php library for generating images of graphs from strings of math notation.

This is a school project and other, better, alternatives probably exists.

At this point the project is far from completion, but if you call createTree with a string of math notation, you can call the evalu method on the object returned, and it will evaluate the expression. Parenthesis are not supported, but you can add an x variable in the expression, and it will be replaced by the argument of the evalu function.
